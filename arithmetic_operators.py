Purpose
-------
Introduction to arithmetic operations in Python. 

Summary 
-------
Python supports the following arithmetic operations:
[+] +  for addition
[+] -  for substraction
[+} *  for multiplication
[+] /  for division
[+] %  for modulus (returns the remainder)
[+} ** for exponentiation

See examples below that are being performed in integer type.

#Example of addition 
addition = 1 + 1 
print("1 + 1 = " + str(addition))

#Example of substraction 
substration = 1 - 1
print("2 - 1 = " + str(substration))

#Example of multiplication
multiplication = 2 * 1
print("2 * 1 = " + str(multiplication))

#Example of division 
division = 4 / 2 
print("4 / 2 = " + str(division))

#Example of modulus 
modulus = 4 % 3 
print("4 % 3 = " + str(modulus)) #4 divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1. That's what modulus is about! 

#Example of exponentiation 
exponent = 2 ** 2 
print("2 ** 2 = " + str(exponent))
